# BTP Documentation

Welcome to BTP! If you ever found yourself having trouble following the documentation of any of BTP's products, we're here for you.

Here we'll be trying to document, simplify, clarify and even correct the official documentation by creating a common mind for all of us to share.

## 🎨 How to use

🎯 Encounter problem \
🔎 Search through this documentation \
🎉 If it exists, use it! \
🛠 If it doesn't, look through the official documentation and find a solution \
📝 Once you solve it, take some time to reflect and update the document if necessary by following [this](#✍-contributing).

There's no feature or issue your future self or another person might not find challenging. So don't fear to write about it even if you'll just embelish it with one extra note. Even if you want to rewrite in a more intuitive way.

Writing things down will even make you understand them better yourself.
